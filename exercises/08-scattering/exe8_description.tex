\subsection*{Exercise No. 8 -- Scattering}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Run the Python script scattering.py. This will simulate the radiation
field at a frequency of $229\,\text{GHz}$ for an atmosphere with
an ice cloud as well for clear-sky. Since this is a one-dimensional
simulation (vertical dimension only), the calculated radiation fields
have two dimensions: altitude (pressure) and zenith angle. The python
script will plot the two radiation fields in the atmosphere at a zenith
angle of $180{^\circ}$. Here, the zenith angle describes the viewing
direction. This means that you are looking at the upward directed
radiation. The unit is brightness temperature. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Describe the difference between cloudy and clear-sky radiation. 
\item Guess where the ice cloud is located in the atmosphere based on the
two radiation fields? 
\item Explain the difference between cloudy and clear-sky radiation.
\end{enumerate}
\item Change the zenith angle (\texttt{zenith\_angle}) from $180{^\circ}$
to $0{^\circ}$ and rerun the Python script.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Describe and explain the difference.
\item Why is the brightness temperature at the top of the atmosphere so
low?
\end{enumerate}
\item Now you will look at the radiation fields as a function of zenith
angle (viewing direction) at a fixed pressure level. In the Python
script, change the variable \texttt{pressure\_level} from \texttt{None}
to a pressure level in $\left[\text{Pa}\right]$, which is within
the ice cloud and rerun the script. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain the shape of the radiation field without the cloud. 
\item How does the radiation field with the cloud differ? 
\end{enumerate}
\item Make the same calculation as in task 3 but with a less or a more dense
ice cloud. To do that, you have to call the function \texttt{scattering()}
within your script with the argument \texttt{ice\_water\_path} set
to your desired value in $\left[\text{kg}\,\text{m}^{-2}\right]$.
The ice water path is the vertically integrated mass content of ice.
In task 3, the function \texttt{scattering()} used a default value
of $2\,\text{kg}\,\text{m}^{-2}$. 
\end{enumerate}
