# Infrastructure for the course 'Applied Remote Sensing'.

## Requirements
The course draws heavily on performing practical exercises using the
[Atmospheric Radiative Transer Simulator][ARTS]. You can check the official
website for information on how to [get ARTS][get-arts].

Students attending the course at Universit√§t Hamburg will find a full ARTS
environment prepared on the university's server ([ARTS lecture][])

To check if the environment is properly set run:
```bash
arts --version
```

## Additional software
The input and output of ARTS makes use of XML files. There are packages to
support the postprocessing of simulation results.

[typhon][] (Python 3) and [atmlab][] (MATLAB) provide reading and writing
routines for ARTS XML files as well as helpful functions related to radiation
and remote sensing.

### atmlab
Run the following command in MATLAB to initialize atmlab (or add it to
your `startup.m`):
```matlab
atmlab_init
```

### typhon
Typhon includes unittests which can be run to test the installation:
```python
pytest --pyarts typhon
```
