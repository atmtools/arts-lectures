# Advanced Radiation and Remote Sensing

A practical introduction to remote sensing using the
_Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator_ ([ARTS][arts]).

The exercises make use of the ARTS Python API.

Required ARTS version is pre-release 2.5.12.

ARTS requires the Miniforge3 Python environment.
Installers can be downloaded from the [Miniforge Github project][conda] page.
If you are not familiar with the installation procedure of Miniforge, [this page provides good instructions][robotology].

After you have installed Miniforge, ARTS can be installed with the following command:
```
mamba install -c rttools pyarts
```

If you use Spyder, Visual Studio Code or any other IDE  to run the Python scripts, make sure to select the correct interpreter path (`~/miniforge3/bin/python`) in your IDE.

Note that ARTS is only available for Linux and macOS. If you are on Windows or have trouble with the setup, students attending the course at Universit√§t Hamburg can use the computers in the pool rooms or the [VDI system of CEN][vdi-cen] as a fallback solution:

After logging in to a Linux virtual machine, running this command will provide a Miniforge environment with pyarts preinstalled:

```
source /data/share/lehre/unix/rtcourse/activate.sh
```
