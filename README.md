# Advanced Radiation and Remote Sensing

A practical introduction to remote sensing using the
_Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator_ ([ARTS][arts]).

The exercises make use of the ARTS Python API.

Required ARTS version is pre-release 2.5.12

Matching catalogs are [available here][cats].

The `environment.yml` file can be used to setup a [conda environment][conda]
with all necessary packages including PyARTS:

mamba env create -f environment.yml
mamba activate arts-lectures
